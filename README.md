Sorting Visualizer
A simple web-based sorting visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using animated visualizations.

Project Overview
This project allows users to visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Users can generate a random array and sort it using any of the implemented algorithms. The visualizer showcases how the sorting takes place by animating the bars representing the array elements.

Features
Generate Array: Generates a random array of integers to be sorted.
Bubble Sort: Visualizes the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Selection Sort: Visualizes the Selection Sort algorithm.
Insertion Sort: Visualizes the Insertion Sort algorithm.
Responsive UI: Works on different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the page.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Sorting algorithms and visualizations.

How to Use
Generate Array: Click the "Generate Array" button to create a random array of numbers represented by bars.
Sort the Array: Click on any of the sorting algorithm buttons (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort) to see the sorting process in action.
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
Implement speed control for the sorting animations.
Add color transitions to show comparisons and swaps.
