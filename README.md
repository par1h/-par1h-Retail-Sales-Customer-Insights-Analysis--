Sorting Visualizer

A simple web-based sorting visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using animated visualizations.


Project Overview

This project allows users to visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Users can generate a random array and sort it using any of the implemented algorithms. The visualizer showcases how the sorting takes place by animating the bars representing the array elements.
